Food decision app.


My idea for it was for a simple app that will give you random suggestions for food (ie pasta, cheeseburger).



The main activity is shows a food in the center.
Swiping left will discard the current food item and show up a new one.
Swiping right will accept the current food and bring up a show view for the food.

Hamster will work on the backend for it. I'll have a simple one done soon
